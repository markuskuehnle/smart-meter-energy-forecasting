# Short note on commit messages

It would be great if we could use **conventional commit** messages

Documentation: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

**Use only these 5 commit types for easier traceability of our commit history:**

Examples:

- adding a new feature:

```
feat: allow provided config object to extend other configs
```

- fixing a bug:

```
fix: prevent racing of requests
```

- changing something without code / function changes

```
chore: update README
```

- commit message with no body (no file content was changes â†’ renames, deletions)

```
docs: correct spelling of CHANGELOG
```

- refactor code

```
refactor: clean up data preprocessing logic
```

No scope specification needed
