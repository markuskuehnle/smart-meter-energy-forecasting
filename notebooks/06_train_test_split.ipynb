    "## Notebook Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook performs a **chronological 80/20 split** of the preprocessed dataset to prepare for time series modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Input:** Encoded, hourly-resampled dataset with engineered features\n",
    "* **Sorting:** Ensures time index is strictly ordered\n",
    "* **Split:** Reserves the final 20% of data as the forecasting holdout set\n",
    "* **Output:** Saves `train.csv` and `forecast.csv` for baseline and ML model training\n",
    "\n",
    "> Purpose: Respect temporal order for causal integrity and prevent lookahead bias in forecasting models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thoughts, Tradeoffs & Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "* **No shuffle allowed:** Time series models break if past and future are mixed. Chronological order is strictly preserved—this is **not optional** in forecasting tasks.\n",
    "* **Static 80/20 ratio:** Chose a fixed 80% train / 20% forecast split to simulate realistic deployment scenarios. Could be adjusted later depending on seasonality span or cross-validation design.\n",
    "* **Forecasting window:** With hourly data, 20% gives \\~2.4 months of holdout—enough to assess robustness across time patterns (e.g., day/night, weekday/weekend, weather shifts).\n",
    "* **Index integrity check:** Sorting the datetime index before the split was critical. Found minor time discontinuities earlier; now fully handled upstream.\n",
    "* **No temporal leakage:** Features like lagged values, weather, and time-based encodings must be computed **only from past data** during model training, this split enforces that discipline.\n",
    "* **Future tweak:** Could later introduce **rolling window** validation or walk-forward retraining, but for now a single static split is sufficient for baseline modeling and prototyping.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Main concern was **preserving causality and temporal realism**. Splitting randomly would give better metrics—but lie about deploy-time performance."
